## 🍄 Mushroom Classification with Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning can be applied to classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous**, aiming to support food safety initiatives. The study evaluates four classification models — **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Naive Bayes** — and further fine-tunes the two best-performing models using **Grid Search for hyperparameter optimization**.

### 📌 Highlights

* **Random Forest** emerged as the best-performing model:

  * ROC AUC close to **100%**
  * High **recall** and **F1-score**
  * Performance improved further after tuning
* Results show the model’s **robustness and generalization** on this dataset.
